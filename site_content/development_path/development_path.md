The preceding section [foundation and services]({% link site_content/foundation_and_services/foundation_and_services.md %}) develops an outline socio-technical engineering plan.  This section considers how to turn that outline plan into reality.  This section does not require earlier material to be understood.  Nor is any previous digital development experience assumed. A multi-phase strawman leadership and development approach is presented.  This is not the only way to develop Project CONCRETE; the intent here is to not leave people in the lurch with a technical outline and a blank page.

## CONCRETE from a leadership and development perspective

Current digital standards (or our lack of them) are acting as a massive drag on efficiency, effectiveness, collaboration, growth, and the quality of social discourse. Project CONCRETE has already produced a strong outline sketch of the technical foundations, associated support services, and tools, that would enable us to remove that drag and reap the rewards.  The realisation of those benefits is not expected to be difficult, but it is expected to 
require a style of government digital leadership and development that has not been seen before. [^international]

[^international]:
    International leadership and alignment.  While the focus here is currently about raising digital leadership and development to a national level, this can be expected to become increasingly important at an international scale.

The technical foundation itself is tiny (at government scales).  It is purposefully the bare minimum necessary to support future digital tools without imposing any undue constraints [^foundation].  This coherently brings together various digital technologies [^yazz].  Working prototypes are already being made.  While further technologies may be required, the main development effort will be to hone the socio-technical design to ensure that it is both fit-for-purpose and trustworthy.  People need solid, performant, well-tested foundations to build on. 

[^foundation]:
    The foundation provides a minimum - security, data, information, resource management..

[^yazz]:
    There are many digital technologies (ontologies, networking, AI etc) whose specialist proponents can, **entirely correctly**, claim would generate benefits if used more widely. From a CONCRETE perspective, there no need to take sides.  There are enormous synergies to gained from choosing and simultaneously enabling all-of-the-above.  The current state of 'digital' is so low that a move in almost any direction would generate benefits. We need to be somewhat careful to ensure that we are aiming to realise the absolute maximum benefits possible.

The technical foundation, and many associated tools, cannot be developed by private companies as products. Expect to need to employ digital engineers in a similar manner to civil engineers working on government infrastructure projects; providing paid engineering services, not generating products to subsequently choose from and buy.  Overall demand for digital specialists can be expected to increase.

The outputs are not something to mandate on a population, they are about the provision of enriching common digital goods that can live alongside existing systems and processes such as:

- Services - financial and digital library-like mechanisms.
- Tools - predominantly software.
- National infrastructure - such as time synchronisation mechanisms, and sovereign industrial capabilities.
- Standards and best practices.

There is no need or desire for any major roll-out plans; people and organisations could make use of these capabilities into their own lives at their own pace. 

The main development phase needs to be conducted as an live incremental engineering activity that is regularly providing new benefits to a focussed group that can act as a useful experimental leading edge.  This work should be communicated openly such that other early adopters can seek benefits from day one. The early stages of development need to focus on honing the digital foundation.  However, in order to do this, it is particularly important to co-develop early tools and services to ensure that the full ecosystem is developing on the right track. As the foundation sets, expect a change of focus and gears.  Emphasis will turn to building tools. It is important to use the early stages to prepare everyone for that acceleration.

## Multi-phase outline plan


Gantt chart? - multi=phase approach showing weeks/2 years/ongoing.

### Phase 0 - Forming

Tidy up and add clarity to the material / development path.  Very small number of specialists in a single room (10-15).

Figure out the organisation - cross-departmental digital leadership is new.

This does not have to be onerous. 

Everyone (all depts) along for the journey - otherwise it'll just be another local stovepipe.

Highest common denominator.  Grew out of the MOD and security services. This does not mean that they have to be in charge.

There are not many things to talk about in the foundation.

6 to 8 weeks.

### Phase 1 - Storming and Norming

Leadership structure is clear - preliminary technical de-risking, and documentation complete.

To place digital development activities on a firm, sustainable strategic footing.

This is an engineering - make something activity - not a study something out of interest (that can happen too)

Make the basic foundation using the original agile manifesto-implied approach.

Expect this to continously deliver , but to take a couple of years.

Contracting methods.

Paid - but also people will be interested and want to add stuff - community.

Communication is important.



Foundation very small number of people - design, development, perfective.  Expect to draw on personnel who are specialist in certain areas.

Agile - benefits start from approximately day 1.  

Lots of parallel prototypical activities.  Concentrated and fast.

Indicative activities LINK here.

Start to accelerate and broaden.  Start to expand the number of people / companies with the necessary skills.  Ready the workforce. A foundation on its own is not really useful.  Start co-developing tools based on the foundation. Pj MICROCOSM - a single gov-industry focal point. Also helps the foundation makers to have the feedback.

Open - at least about the foundations, not the use cases.  Start to improve the communication.  Anyone can take / use any bits at any time.

Not just about the technical development - need to do the socio and cultural - need to learn how to do this.

Want to understand the average user journey and to have lead examples.

Services - what scale - learn how to do this.

Relatively small - too many people too soon is not helpful - still reasurringly expensive.


### Phase 2a - Performing

Standard has stabilised. 

Foundation entering a monitoring and maintenance part of its lifecycle.

Foundation development with preliminary tool making swaps to foundation monitoring and management and all-out tool making.

Continue to Accelerate hard - emphasis turns to tool making. 

Larger numbers of tool makers.

Where to accelerate hard - political.

Crowd funding not competition.  Organisation becomes more of a coordination activity.

The desired end state is to have the processes and organisational structures in place to enable the UK to make, maintain and exploit world-leading digital standards and associated best practices. User needs are being efficiently and effectively collated and communicated to a strong high-tech academic and industrial base. The implications for new technical/computing developments are being recognised and exploited to generate best-of-class capabilities.

### Phase 2b - Preparing

The main effort will have great digital leadership, but ..

Small team preparing for the next major iteration.

Don't forget how we got here.

Red team - starts again.

Start V2 straight away.  Don't ossify again.

## Timing

Don't get left behind.

This is coming anyway - nothing new here.
