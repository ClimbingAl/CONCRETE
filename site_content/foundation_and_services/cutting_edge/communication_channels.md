Communication as part of the whole

Matrix?

IPFS and IOTA - may make this easy.

 
email is somewhat evil.

Meeting conversation vs minutes.

Link with information security - discussions, issues, and this.

Want to be able to link to a subject.

While all conversations are somewhat private - want to be able to add them to the flow of information.

Monitorable channels = automatically adding guard users - with IOTA smart contract links to ensure that they are not used without a process.

Communication within a room - argumentation, meeting support...
